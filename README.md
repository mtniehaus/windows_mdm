# Windows MDM Demo In Go Lang
## Currently Not Working
I was trying to develop an MDM server to manage Windows 10 computers using the built in protocol and I found the documentation really difficult to understand and I could not find any open source demo on the internet. So this is what I have managed to create. It does not do SOAP parsing (yet) but it is trying to show how the protocol works in a practical way.
